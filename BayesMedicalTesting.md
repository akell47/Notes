A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

1. Be positive
2. Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
3. Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
4. Misclassify the person

 | Tripshaw | No Tripshaw | Total
--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
Test + | .49 | 9.95 | 10.44
Test - | .01 | 89.55 | 89.56
Total | .50 | 99.5 | 100

### Answers
1. Probability test is positive is 10.44/100 = .1044 or 10.44%
2. Probability correct diagnoses of Thripshaw's = .49/.5 = .98 or 98%
3. Probability correct diagnosis of NO Tripshaw's 89.55/99.5 = .09 or 90%
4. Misclassify = .01 + 9.95)/100 = 0.0996 or 9.996%
