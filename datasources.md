In each of the scenarios, find possible shortcomings of the theoretical or actual data sources to answer the given question. What could be done to either adjust the analysis or reframe the question so that you can answer it accurately?

*Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?* <br>
<br>
Well this is during Christmas, pretty major holiday in that region and nearly worldwide. It is better to scrape dates throughout the year, or just get a dataset for a whole (recent) year.

*Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?*
Again date related. A pretty major historical event happened the day before that was quite traumatizing for the USA as it was a significant and the only terrorist attack.  Obviously this would have a greatest impact by New Yorkers in very close proximity to the major historical terrorist attack event.

*Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?*
What is the time frame of the online survey?
Where online was the survey? Did the survey have adds to reach other sites? 
Overall good dataset.
