1. *Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: `HTTH`, `HHHH` and `TTHH`.* <br>
<br>
The probability of H or T each toss is .5 or 50%. The tosses are independent so `.5*.5*.5*.5 = .0625` or `6.25%`. <br>
<br>
2. *If a list of people has 24 women and 21 men, then the probability of choosing a man from the list is 21/45. What is the probability of not choosing a man?* <br>
<br>
21 men, total = 45.  No man = 45 - 21 = 24. <br>
`P(man) = 24/45` <br>
<br>
3. *The probability that Bernice will travel by plane sometime in the next year is 10%. The probability of a plane crash at any time is .005%. What is the probability that Bernice will be in a plane crash sometime in the next year?*<br>
<br>
independent events <br>
`P(plane crash \bigcap travel by plane) =  P(plane crash) * P(travel by plane) = (.01) * (.00005) = .000005` or `.0005%`<br>
